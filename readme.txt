Basically, program takes inputs as parameters and prints outputs.
We have n+1 command line inputs for the coefficients of f(x)=a_n x^n+a_(n-1) x^(n-1)+?+a_1 x+a_0 in the order from a_n  to a_0. Used dynamically allocated memory to store these.
We have 3 more command line arguments for the initial guesses x0, x1  (x1>x0) and the tolerance value to.
You have to give inputs as parameters when compiling the program in Dev C++.
